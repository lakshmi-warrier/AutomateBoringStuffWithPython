    "- **Steps for using regex** (re module)\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Import the regex module with import re.\n",
    "    - Create a Regex object with the re.compile() function. (Remember to use a raw string.)\n",
    "    - Pass the string you want to search into the Regex object’s search() method. This returns a Match object.\n",
    "    - Call the Match object’s group() method to return a string of the actual matched text.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Grouping with paranthesis**\n",
    "    - (\\d\\d\\d)-(\\d\\d\\d-\\d\\d\\d\\d) -> group 1: first 3 digits, group2: digits after first \n",
    "    - `mo.group()` or `mo.group(0)` returns the entire matched string in a string format\n",
    "    - `mo.group(n)` gives the nth matched string\n",
    "    - `mo.groups()` gives the entire matched string in tuple format\n",
    "- **Pipe operator -** `or`\n",
    "    - the first occurrence of matching text will be returned as the Match object.\n",
    "    - `heroRegex.search('Tina Fey and Batman').group()` will return `Tina Fey`\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Question mark -?** - to match with an optional string or to declare a non-greedy match\n",
    "    - \"This is a mandatory part (while this is optional)?\" is an alternate to \"This is a mandatory part while this is optional | This is a mandatory part\"\n",
    "    - Adding a ? to the end of the {start, stop} operator matches the shortest string possible\n",
    "- **Asterisk - * -** Matches any number of a particular occurence\n",
    "    - used when we need to get any string which has any number of occurence of a particular string\n",
    "    - (any)* -> returns any Match if it has \"any\"\n",
    "    - If no `any` is found, it returns `None`\n",
    "- **Plus operator-+** - matches one or more occurences\n",
    "\n",
    "            - Regex A? matches zero or one occurrences of A.\n",
    "            - Regex A* matches zero or more occurrences of A.\n",
    "            - Regex A+ matches one or more occurrences of A.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- **Curly Braces-{}** - Return Match if a string repeats n number of times\n",
    "    - (3times){3} - equivalent regex:  \"3times3times3times\"\n",
    "    - (3times){3,5} - equivalent regex: \"3times3times3times|3times3times3times3times|3times3times3times3times3times\" -> 3, 4, or 5 occurence\n",
    "    - BY default this returns the longest matching string even if there are shorter matching string. This approach is called *Greedy*. Inorder to get the shortest possible match, use **?**\n",
    "- **search() vs. findall()**\n",
    "    - search() returns only the first occurence while findall() returns every occurence in a list format\n",
    "        - list of strings - if there are no groups\n",
    "        - list of tuples of strings - if there are groups\n",
    "- **CHARACTER CLASSES** \n",
    "    - Shorthand representation of broad long stings of regex\n",
    "    - the class is defined in square bracket. [aieouAIEOU] can check for all vowels, capital or small\n",
    "    - the contents in the class need not be escaped. \n",
    "    - Therefore, adding a space as shown `[aeiou AEIOU]` will match with space character\n",
    "    - The classes can also contain ranges. `[a-zA-Z0-9]` will match every letters of English alphabet and every numeric digits\n",
    "    - A caret `^` immediately after the opening of class bracket makes a negative class. Adding `^` anywhere inside character class checks for match with`^`\n",
    "    \n",
    "- $ and ^\n",
    "    - dollar sign  at the end of the regex matches if the string ends with the specified regex\n",
    "    - ^ at the start of a regex matches if the string if it begins with the specified regex "
